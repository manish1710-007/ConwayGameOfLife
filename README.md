Conway's Game of Life is a classic example of a cellular automaton, a mathematical model used to simulate complex systems consisting of simple individual components interacting with each other according to certain rules. It was invented by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

In the Game of Life, the "universe" is represented as a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two possible states: alive or dead. The grid is typically two-dimensional, although variations exist in higher dimensions.

The game proceeds in discrete steps or generations. At each step, the state of each cell in the grid is updated based on a set of rules. These rules determine the state of each cell in the next generation based on the current state of the cell and its neighboring cells.

The rules of Conway's Game of Life are as follows:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

These simple rules can give rise to complex patterns and behaviors, including stable structures, oscillators, and gliders that move across the grid indefinitely. Despite its simplicity, the Game of Life has been widely studied and has applications in various fields, including computer science, biology, and physics. It serves as an example of emergent complexity arising from simple rules.
